# power-bi-project
In this sales analysis project I have use most popular visualisation tool that is POWER BI . 
I've developed a Power BI sales analysis project that provides a comprehensive overview of our sales performance. This project utilizes interactive dashboards and visualizations to track key sales metrics, analyze trends, and gain insights into our product categories, customer behavior, and geographic markets. It offers valuable information for decision-making, including identifying top-performing products, customer segments, and areas for improvement. With this project, we can make data-driven decisions to enhance our sales strategy and boost profitability. This is a dynamic project so that if any values get added into data sets in future it will reflect in dashboard automativally we just need to refresh it once and we can see the updated data in our report. 
using slicers we can get report for our desired area , months and year .
